Coursera Guided Projects Resources

1) [Hyperparameter Tuning with Neural Network Intelligence](https://github.com/rajithst/coursera-projects/tree/master/Hyperparameter%20Tuning%20with%20Neural%20Network%20Intelligence) ( [Project Link](https://www.coursera.org/projects/hyperparameter-tuning) )<br>
   Hyperparameter tuning using Microsoft's Neural Network Intelligence (NNI) AutoML toolkit created by Microsoft.Neural Network Intelligence (NNI) which can help machine learning practitioners automate Feature engineering, Hyperparameter tuning, Neural Architecture search and Model compression. 

2. [Image Data Augmentation with Keras](https://github.com/rajithst/coursera-projects/tree/master/Image%20Data%20Augmentation%20with%20Keras)
   [Project Link](https://www.coursera.org/projects/data-augmentation-keras) <br>
   Image Augmentation using the `ImageDataGenerator` class from Kerasâ€™ image preprocessing package
   
3. [Siamese Network with Triplet Loss in Keras](https://github.com/rajithst/coursera-projects/tree/master/Siamese%20Network%20with%20Triplet%20Loss%20in%20Keras)
   [Project Link](https://www.coursera.org/projects/siamese-network-triplet-loss-keras) <br> 
   Implement a Triplet Loss function, create a Siamese Network, and train the network with the Triplet Loss function. With this training process, the network will      learn to produce Embedding of different classes from a given dataset in a way that Embedding of examples from different classes will start to move away from each    other in the vector space.
